# Minecraft 2D Game Project

This is a **2D game** inspired by the famous **Minecraft** open-world game. The project was created using **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**. Players can generate a new world, use tools to interact with the environment, and modify the game world by adding or removing tiles.
